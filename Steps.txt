First: prepare some requirements:
        1- how front-end designer begin a design? 
                https://youtu.be/S6JSIpZCPWU?si=UQz86FZ1dcAU2ecc

        2- Create project folder, then create in it css and images folders and index file.

        3- Create css file

        3- In html file header:
                -- edit the title
                -- link css file
                -- download and link normalize.css file: it used to render all elements normally and solve some bugs, there are frameworks use it.
                        https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
                -- link google fonts from https://fonts.google.com/
                        then apply the font in body tag in css file
        
        4- Prepare virtual sections in css file :
                -- variable sections
                -- component section
                -- global rules section
                -- header section
                -- landing section
                -- features section
                -- services section
                -- portfolio section



        4- Edit box-sizing property in root tag in css file to (border-box)

        5- Link font awesome to use icons from it:
                -- go https://fontawesome.com/ --> download for web --> copy webfont folder and paste in project folder
                -- from font awesome folder --> css --> copy all.min.css --> paste in css project folder - there is all.css that's same but the first is minified and second for preview-
                -- in header of html link all.min.css 
                Then can use any icon from fontawesome --> icons, and copy html code put it in project

Second: design
        
In Css:
        * Container class in global rules :
                Why? we have parent (any parent in design like header, footer....), it will be for background with full width
                Then we have container in it, because in our design and a lot of others the content have to be in center of page not have full width - in other words, the content should have some space in both sides(left&right) and isnt start directly from page beginning-
                we will put containers in different places in design, Any element has container class will have same spaces in both sides(same general shape) 
                -- make global css rules for (.container) include margin & padding
                --  and media queries for make container responsive(from bootstrap)
        
        * Components:
                * Special-heading component: notice there are repeated heading in many places, so will make global component for it with medea query.
                * Special-p component: notice there are repeated paragraphs in many places, so will make global component for it.

        * Global variables:
                main-color and any needed variables in the process of writing the code in gradually


In Html:
        1- Header :
                --has container, include:
                        .logo div
                        .links div include:
                                icon(from fontqwesome or custum made)
                                ul(number of li's)
        
        2- Landing Section
                add global variable has main color that is used in page*
                -- has h3 and paragraph

        3- Features Section
                -- has container
                        --- has 3 .feat div
                                ---- each has i, h3, .special-p(p)*

        4- Services Section:
                -- has .container(div)   
                        --- has special-heading(h2)* with paragraph
                        --- has .service-content (div)
                                ---- has 3 col div
                                        ----- each has two .srv div else last one has image 
                                                ------ each .srv has i, text div(has h3, special-p*)

        - Repeated component -> make class for it (framework)
